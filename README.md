Offspring (NXT desktop wallet)
==============================

Offspring is [NXT](http://www.nxtcrypto.org/) desktop wallet software. With Offspring you can create and manage your NXT accounts, send/receive NXT coins, assets and more.

Offspring uses the NXT Java. This allows for fast access to all data in the blockchain. All displayed transactions, accounts and blocks can be clicked and inspected.

Offspring was developed by [DGEX the BTC / NXT Cryptocurrency Exchange](http://dgex.com/)
